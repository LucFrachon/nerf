# Neural Radiance Fields from Scratch

This is a notebook that I developed when exploring the super cool topic of NeRFs for a Medium blog post.
I wrote it after reading the NeRF paper (Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R. and Ng, R., 2021. "NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis". Communications of the ACM, 65(1), pp.99â€“106.) and will use some of the plots in the post.

It is not the most efficient implementation, but I found it easier to understand and explain.
